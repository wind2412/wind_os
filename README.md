# wind_os

a simple os, no gui

## ATTENTIONS

The bootloader is from XV6. OS designing thinking is from mostly ucore, little from linux 0.11 kernel. And hurley_os kernel helped a lot, on my os learing road.

Thanks for all of U !
    
This kernel doesn't has a file system. It is really simple for os learning.

1. if you are on i386 linux, please delete the `Makefile`'s all prefix `i386-elf-`, and run `make && make qemu` is okay.
2. if you are on mac OS, please install i386 tool chains first.
